Brief of exercises:
WeatherPy:
1. Generate randon latitude and logitude coordinates for 500+ cities with no duplicates
2. Perf API calls to OpenWeather to return key attributes
3. Store results in dataframe
4. Examine data for humidity > 100% - not possible
5. Create various plots and linear regression analyses and output as figures

VacationPy:
1. Use the data output from WeatherPy
2. Create a heatmap based on Humidity
3. Filter dataframe to ideal weather conditions
4. Use google places api to return hotels within 5000 meters of the cities with ideal weather
5. Add hotel markers to the heatmap with labels
